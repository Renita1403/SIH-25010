## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a farmer-first digital advisory ecosystem that integrates AI, local language processing, and image recognition. It delivers tailored, location-specific, and easy-to-understand agricultural guidance. The solution uniquely combines scientific accuracy with accessibility through voice interfaces, multilingual chatbots, and offline support. This ensures that even digitally less-experienced farmers benefit from advanced agri-tech innovations.
A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot offering real-time, location-specific crop advisory.

Soil health monitoring with personalized fertilizer guidance.

Weather-based alerts and predictive insights to support timely decision-making.

Pest and disease detection via image uploads and AI-driven analysis.

Market price tracking to help farmers maximize profitability.

Voice-based support for low-literate users.

Feedback and usage analytics for continuous improvement and adaptation to local needs.

## Technical Approach
Technologies Used: AI/ML models for predictive analytics, Natural Language Processing for multilingual/voice support, Image Recognition for pest/disease detection, Cloud-based backend for real-time data, and mobile app/chatbot interfaces.

Methodology:

Data integration from soil health cards, weather APIs, and market feeds.

Real-time processing using AI to generate actionable insights.

Delivery of personalized advisories via mobile app, SMS, or voice assistant.

Feedback loop for continuous improvement and farmer-specific learning.

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility: With rising smartphone penetration and affordable data in rural India, a mobile-based solution is practical and scalable.

Potential Challenges: Low digital literacy, inconsistent connectivity, and initial adoption resistance.

Mitigation Strategies: Voice-based support, offline features, community training programs, and government/NGO partnerships for farmer outreach.
## Impact and Benefits
Social: Empowers farmers with knowledge, reduces dependence on middlemen, and improves community resilience.

Economic: Increases crop yield, reduces input costs, and improves profitability.

Environmental: Promotes sustainable use of fertilizers and pesticides, reducing soil and water pollution.
